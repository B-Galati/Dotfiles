BE VERY CAREFUL HERE!
If you screw up something here, you might end up not been able to boot into your system!



If you decide that you want to modify the .css file here yourself, make sure that you don´t delete some vital part of it (for example, a bracket), because GDM wont be able to load at startup in that case, and you won´t be able to boot into your system easily.

If you do end up screwing something up and GDM ends up not loading at startup, you need to somehow get to the location "/usr/share/gnome-shell" and fix your default theme. (Re-apply the old theme which you backed up.)

You can get there either by booting into another distro and mounting this partition in the file manager or via comand line if you know how to do it.




In any case, if you aren´t willing to risk this, then do not modify your root theme!!!
And please, don´t complain to me about it. You have been warned. >_<

Nevertheless, applying this style is easy as pie.


	1. Navigate to /usr/share/gnome-shell as root.


	2. Backup your "theme" folder!! (For example, copy it, and rename it to "theme_backup".)


	3. Copy-paste the content of the "ciliora-prima-login-style" folder into your "theme" folder.


	4. Restart your theme. (Alt + f2, then "rt".)


	5. In order to revert the login theme, delete/rename your "theme" folder, and rename the "theme_backup" folder back to "theme".

This has only been tested on gnome-shell 3.12 so far!!

Because all themes are build in such a way that they override only elements of the default theme, most of them will not look good as long as this modified theme remains your default theme. Most noticable will be the popups because most themes do not override the "border-image" property in the ".popup-menu" selector.

For this reason, if you want to apply another theme other then zukitwo-dark, you will have to re-apply the old default theme in usr/share/gnome-shell (ie. rename "theme_backup" back to "theme").
